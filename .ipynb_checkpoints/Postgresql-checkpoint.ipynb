      "(1, '我們要開始這個禮拜的課程這個禮拜會到佼佼作業二然後宣布作業三我們今天的內容會是網路爬蟲也會是作業三的重點所以我會把今天的整個範例講完以後你們可以選擇你自己能力內可以寫到的程度因為寫程式其實有幾個階段一個階段是第二個階段是可以跑而且內容要正確第三個階段是可以跑內容要正確之後你還要能力模組化模組化的意思就是你可以把它建成function那這個模組化呢如果你要分享給更多不同的專案使用你還要能夠建成class就好像你去應用一個模組化你還要能夠建成class今天我就會針對這四個步驟來去講程式品質的四個階段那我喜歡上課模式都是融合性的就是我剛剛在描述的這四個階段可能很多時候會變成是一門叫做軟體工程的課然後它都是在產生在用軟體工程的方式然後你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到然後它都是在產出寫程式的結構可是如果你沒有融入一個情境跟直接帶入一個實作你看完了你覺得好像在念一本如何管理程式的書可是其實你也不知道怎麼寫那你可以自己評估自己的實力來去把你的程式碼寫到多模組化能夠去分享給別人那上學期我是要求說他們一定要寫成模組化去分享給其他同學使用後來發現還蠻多同學做不到所以我今年就放寬就是你只要能夠寫出爬蟲但是我不限定你',

Super沒有辦法直接幫你解決你就要再去看一些進階的網頁開發的攻略然後才能知道要多寫些什麼東西去完成那種複雜網站的爬曲那爬蟲它是依網站而去寫的程式所以它不會是那種寫完一遍以後它就放出四行接准因為網頁的設計每一個網站都長不一樣除非那個網站幾十年來都沒有變有這樣的網站當然有PTT就是這樣幾十年來都沒有變所以我上課的範例一定都用PTT因為它的程式碼幾乎就不用改那如果說你是抓那種商業網站它為了防堵這些爬蟲程式一直干擾它的頻寬它會常常變動也會在裡面塞一些讓你爬起來很難改程式的按碼那這是正常因為這是個工坊它沒有允許你可以偷它的東西那爬蟲它本來就是在一個灰色地帶所以你要提取一個別人沒有Open',

'Source給你的Data只是它公開在網站上秀出來它期望的是人真的去跟它互動而不是機器跟它互動所以爬蟲它並沒有嚴明規定說你不能爬但是你如果要爬它也會做一些防堵的行為所以爬蟲它本來就是一個沒有被很確認說它到底是合法還是非法的行為那所以這些商家它就會自己做一些保護措施所以你會說有些網站爬不下來那我就會說有可能它的防堵功率比你的程式功率高所以你爬不到就這麼簡單而已那BeautifulSoup它只是在建立你在提取Tag內的內容你比較有結構化的工具可以去提取方便你能夠在找到對的欄位的時候把資料抽出來有點像是Regular Expletion的那種感覺所以它沒有說什麼網站它都可以幫你爬到如果你要去爬其他網站你要解析其他網站複雜的那些按碼的時候那個你還要再去多學一些前端的概念所以我們今天不會帶那麼多所以我就是帶一些爬蟲的基礎知識好那爬蟲的流程是這樣子就是你一定會有一個對應的URL而且那個URL它是活著的如果你發現你URL送過去它Response回來是404就有兩種情況一個是你的網址根本就打錯了所以它找不到那個網站第二個就是那個網站關掉服務了所以如果你回應的Request不是200200叫做Connect',

'我們要開始這個禮拜的課程這個禮拜會到佼佼作業二然後宣布作業三我們今天的內容會是網路爬蟲也會是作業三的重點所以我會把今天的整個範例講完以後你們可以選擇你自己能力內可以寫到的程度因為寫程式其實有幾個階段一個階段是第二個階段是可以跑而且內容要正確第三個階段是可以跑內容要正確之後你還要能力模組化模組化的意思就是你可以把它建成function那這個模組化呢如果你要分享給更多不同的專案使用你還要能夠建成class就好像你去應用一個模組化你還要能夠建成class今天我就會針對這四個步驟來去講程式品質的四個階段那我喜歡上課模式都是融合性的就是我剛剛在描述的這四個階段可能很多時候會變成是一門叫做軟體工程的課然後它都是在產生在用軟體工程的方式然後你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到你會看到然後它都是在產出寫程式的結構可是如果你沒有融入一個情境跟直接帶入一個實作你看完了你覺得好像在念一本如何管理程式的書可是其實你也不知道怎麼寫那你可以自己評估自己的實力來去把你的程式碼寫到多模組化能夠去分享給別人那上學期我是要求說他們一定要寫成模組化去分享給其他同學使用後來發現還蠻多同學做不到所以我今年就放寬就是你只要能夠寫出爬蟲但是我不限定你',

'Super這個套件其實爬蟲的工具有超級多不是只有這一套那我教這一套算是簡單好上手那它也是有一些局限性的所以它只能抓比較簡單的網站那種比較複雜的類似像臉書它會擋一些爬蟲的行為或者是有一些你是要往下滑動它才會產生新的頁面出來的這種動態生成的或者是它的網站會有一些警示然後不讓你直接連續一直爬的這些可能Beautiful Super沒有辦法直接幫你解決你就要再去看一些進階的網頁開發的攻略然後才能知道要多寫些什麼東西去完成那種複雜網站的爬曲那爬蟲它是依網站而去寫的程式所以它不會是那種寫完一遍以後它就放出四行接准因為網頁的設計每一個網站都長不一樣除非那個網站幾十年來都沒有變有這樣的網站當然有PTT就是這樣幾十年來都沒有變所以我上課的範例一定都用PTT因為它的程式碼幾乎就不用改那如果說你是抓那種商業網站它為了防堵這些爬蟲程式一直干擾它的頻寬它會常常變動也會在裡面塞一些讓你爬起來很難改程式的按碼那這是正常因為這是個工坊它沒有允許你可以偷它的東西那爬蟲它本來就是在一個灰色地帶所以你要提取一個別人沒有Open',

Super沒有辦法直接幫你解決你就要再去看一些進階的網頁開發的攻略然後才能知道要多寫些什麼東西去完成那種複雜網站的爬曲那爬蟲它是依網站而去寫的程式所以它不會是那種寫完一遍以後它就放出四行接准因為網頁的設計每一個網站都長不一樣除非那個網站幾十年來都沒有變有這樣的網站當然有PTT就是這樣幾十年來都沒有變所以我上課的範例一定都用PTT因為它的程式碼幾乎就不用改那如果說你是抓那種商業網站它為了防堵這些爬蟲程式一直干擾它的頻寬它會常常變動也會在裡面塞一些讓你爬起來很難改程式的按碼那這是正常因為這是個工坊它沒有允許你可以偷它的東西那爬蟲它本來就是在一個灰色地帶所以你要提取一個別人沒有Open',

'Source給你的Data只是它公開在網站上秀出來它期望的是人真的去跟它互動而不是機器跟它互動所以爬蟲它並沒有嚴明規定說你不能爬但是你如果要爬它也會做一些防堵的行為所以爬蟲它本來就是一個沒有被很確認說它到底是合法還是非法的行為那所以這些商家它就會自己做一些保護措施所以你會說有些網站爬不下來那我就會說有可能它的防堵功率比你的程式功率高所以你爬不到就這麼簡單而已那BeautifulSoup它只是在建立你在提取Tag內的內容你比較有結構化的工具可以去提取方便你能夠在找到對的欄位的時候把資料抽出來有點像是Regular Expletion的那種感覺所以它沒有說什麼網站它都可以幫你爬到如果你要去爬其他網站你要解析其他網站複雜的那些按碼的時候那個你還要再去多學一些前端的概念所以我們今天不會帶那麼多所以我就是帶一些爬蟲的基礎知識好那爬蟲的流程是這樣子就是你一定會有一個對應的URL而且那個URL它是活著的如果你發現你URL送過去它Response回來是404就有兩種情況一個是你的網址根本就打錯了所以它找不到那個網站第二個就是那個網站關掉服務了所以如果你回應的Request不是200200叫做Connect',
